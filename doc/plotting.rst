Plotting

Precision vs recall curves for each evaluation run are generated by default and
stored in the ``results`` subfolder of the model output directory.

To generate a comparison chart of various models use the ``compare`` command
and pass as arguments the output paths of the models you would like to plot.

E.g.:

.. code-block:: bash

    bob binseg compare -o myoutput -l myoutput/DRIVE/M2U-Net myoutput/DRIVE/U-Net myoutput/DRIVE/HED -t MyPlotTitle

Use ``bob binseg compare --help`` for more information.
